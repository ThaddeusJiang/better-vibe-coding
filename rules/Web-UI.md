# HTML

- Never use `<p>`, always use `<div>`

## CSS

- Tailwindcss v4 **no longer needs a tailwind.config.js**
- Tailwind CSS v4 + DaisyUI v5
- Use Tailwind CSS classes and custom CSS rules to create polished, responsive, and visually stunning interfaces.
- Never use `@apply` when writing raw css
- Always manually write your own tailwind-based components instead of using daisyUI for a unique, world-class design
